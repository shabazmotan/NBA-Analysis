Conducted Data Analysis to visualize interactive statistics about the NBA. Utilized Javascript and Plotly to create an interactive dashboard. Our goal was to find and display the top offensive performers in the NBA based on TS% (True Shooting Percentage) and top defensive players in the NBA based on steals per game and blocks per game for the 2021-2022 NBA Regular Season.
